This directory contains code to read and process catalogues from the MPA-JHU Physical properties for galaxies and active galactic nuclei.

data available at http://www.mpa-garching.mpg.de/SDSS/DR7/

I have included code to read in and process the catalogues that contain stellar masses and star formation rates.  

I have alos included the code i use to make a unique catalog, choosing the observation with the highest S/N.

Note: I get 868492 unique objects, not the 818333 quoted on the above webpage.
